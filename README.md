My personal website, blog, and portfolio: https://www.chrisjaeger.me

I will have a full write up of this build in my blog.

This site follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

### Built with
- [Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) with bulma replaced with [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
