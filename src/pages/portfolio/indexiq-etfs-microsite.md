This microsite was promoted across the web and centered around a large marketing campaign to promote investment products, capture leads, and demo an investment analytics tool. 

I built the microsite with a custom responsive framework using [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout), embeded video with the [Brightcove API](https://docs.brightcove.com/), and used the Web API's [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) and [SessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) to pass data from the microsite to an embeded iframe modal which contained the investment analytics tool. I also worked with the analytics team to integrate Google Tag Manager scripts into specific calls to action with JavaScript events.
