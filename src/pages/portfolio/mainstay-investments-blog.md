summary: >- 
  This project was developed for New York Life Investments to serve as the main marketing hub for up-to-date investment insights. My role in this project was Lead Developer, where I was responsible for all aspects of development (project architecture, technologies used, development team workflow, custom plugins, maintenance, etc.) and to help onboard the use of WordPress as marketing tool. I worked closely with the design team and content marketing team to reason about responsive UI/UX, customize dashboard functionality to streamline internal productivity, and to optimize peformance for our mobile users through responsive images, lazy loading, and to avoid using bloated thrid party plugins and build them by hand instead.
